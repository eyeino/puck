Control logic for Puck, a controllable robot designed for children with cerebral palsy

Puck is a remotely-controlled robot designed as an educational tool for severely mentally and physically handicapped students.
It was designed with input from the John G. Leach School in New Castle, Delaware.

There are two libraries in use by the Puck control logic: the Adafruit motor driver V2 library and ButtonV2 by AndrewMascolo.
